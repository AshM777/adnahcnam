I just came across this tweet today that blew my mind. A sample blog page that demonstrates the inclusion of Tweets/Timelines/etc.

# Tweet
An example of displaying a tweet:
{% twitter https://twitter.com/rubygems/status/518821243320287232 %}

# Timeline
An example of pulling from a timeline:
{% twitter https://twitter.com/jekyllrb maxwidth=500 limit=3 %}

# Additional Details
# my new heading
